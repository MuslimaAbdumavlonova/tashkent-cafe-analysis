# Tashkent Cafe Market Analysis

This project analyzes café competition in Tashkent to simulate a real
business decision: where to open a new café.

## Business Question
If we plan to open a new café in Tashkent:
- Which districts have the highest competition?
- Where might there be market opportunities?
- What price level is most common across districts?

## Data
The dataset was collected manually from Google Maps and includes:
- Café name
- District
- Rating
- Review count
- Price level
- Geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude)

The original data was collected in Excel and then cleaned and processed
using Python.

## Analysis Steps
- Loaded and inspected raw data
- Cleaned and standardized column names
- Converted numeric fields to correct data types
- Explored rating distributions and review counts
- Compared café density and average ratings across districts
- Visualized key patterns using Python

## Key Insights
- Some districts show high café density but lower average ratings
- Other districts have fewer cafés but strong customer engagement
- Mid-range cafés dominate most districts, suggesting a competitive market

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Visual Studio Code
- Git & GitHub

## Status
Completed exploratory analysis.  
This project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis workflow on real-world data.
